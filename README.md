# food-planer
This food planner for Notion helps to organize your shopping lists and menu.

You can create lists of dishes you like and also list of products, mark the ones you have in the fridge, so the program will show you the list of dishes you can prepare right now.

You also can mark some dishes in the list and get the shopping list with needed ingredients.

Interaction with the application occurs through a bot.

Unfortunately, Notion does not yet provide the opportunity to fully use this application in duplicates of my original Notion page.
